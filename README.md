# Simulation of Operating System Scheduling algorithms
To simulate a system in order to achieve a better insight of operation system scheduling.

CPU scheduling is a technique used by computer operating systems to manage the usage of the computerâ€™s central processing unit. 
A Process Scheduler executes different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. 
We are going to implement the following four scheduling algorithms in our project.

.First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling

.Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling

.Priority Scheduling

.Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
