# Simulation-of--Operating--System--Scheduling-algorithms
To simulate a system in order to achieve a better insight of operation system scheduling.

A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. We are going to implement the following four scheduling algorithms in our project.

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling

Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
